  Description:
    Abstract:
      Land use and land cover of the San Joaquin Valley
      of California and surrounding areas.
    Purpose:
      To help assess the availability of suitable habitat
      for upland species of the San Joaquin Valley
    Supplemental_Information:
      This is probably the final draft of verison 1 of
      the ESRP land cover data. There is a version 2 planned with
      additional data sources and improved methodology for regular
      updates.

        Cross checked, added to, and refined attribute
        information for urban areas from basemap established in
        step 1. This was done using ARC/INFO polygon overlay and
        topology editing tools (JOIN, ELIMINATE

        (JOIN, ELIMINATE DISSOLVE).
      Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: FMMP
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Added land cover classes from the GAP data within
        areas classified as generic "undeveloped" on our basemap
        from step 1. These include DWR lands classified as "Native
        Vegeation" or "Unirrigated Pasture" and FMMP lands
        classified as "Grazing Lands" or "Other Lands".
      Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: GAP

        Edited land cover classes for wetlands from the

        classified as "Native Vegeation" or "Unirrigated Pasture"

      Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: ETM_iso
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        We clipped the Landsat data to only the areas
        containing non-developed upland communities and classified
        the masked data to 16 categories using an Iterative
        Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). The two
        brightest and one darkest categories where converted to a
        shapefile.
      Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: ETM_iso
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        We calculated the area of each individual polygon
        area from the last step. We converted our data to a
        shapefile and reviewed the data by zooming to each polygon
        in the reverse order of size. Where we found errors, we
        manually corrected the error and changed classifications
        using secondary sources such as the Landsat image, a higher
        resolution SPOT image, and USGS topographic maps. We
        stopped reviewing when we got down to an arbitrary polygon
        size of 85 ha.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      To normalize the attribute data between sources, we
      cross-walked their native classification to a common
      classification based on the USGS Anderson level II
      classification system (Anderson et al. 1976). This
      classification system was modified to include classes of
      interest in the San Joaquin Valley such as retired farmland,
      idle farmland, desert scrub, and Valley-foothill riparian
      communities.
