```{r setup}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

ants <- read.csv("Clean Data/ants_clean.csv")

m1 <- glm(abun ~ Microsite + month + dry.veg.percent + dominant.type, family = "poisson", data = ants)
summary(m1)
```



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
